# Bevy

Bevy is an app to provide the user with a map-based representation of what events are happening in their area. Offers option to sort by event category and timeframe.

## Getting Started

* When Google requests permission to access your current location, please select "allow"; this is required for the app to function.
* The map will display all events within 30 miles of your location for the current week. To narrow (or widen) the search, select a new category and time frame in the nav bar, and the map will automatically refresh with your search results.
* Click on event pins to view basic event info, find the link to the event page on Eventful, or post about the event to Twitter.
* Functionality to sign up for event newsletter coming soon.
